# gameoflife

Created just for fine. I originally wrote a game of life simulator in 1986 in C, from computer weekly magazine.
I borrowed a lot of the python example from http://trevorappleton.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/python-game-of-life.html and tweeked a few bit for my own preference

Feel free to take the code and do your own changes
